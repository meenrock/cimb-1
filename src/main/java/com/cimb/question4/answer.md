Honestly the question 1 took to the longer to create the test case
first then proceeding to the satisfied those cases.

But logically the way to climb flight of stair is easy to get lost the logic 
while you can just keep it simple by forget the way to climb
stair and focused on number of variation to climb the stair.

The second question took the longer because the requirement
of formatting the string is quite daunting at first that
I spend time to validate the format. while this is actually
unnecessary.

In the real life sometime the requirement can be unclear or 
change several time during the course of development cycle.
So it is crucial to think forward and also keep the problem simple.
Dividing big problem into smaller problem. So the logic 
would be easier to verify and test by other parties.
